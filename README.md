Your task is to write a computer program in any programming language you are comfortable. The program should allow the user to perform binary operations and conversion of number systems. It should be a menu-driven where your users can choose from the following options

Menu-1 (Main Menu)

[1] Binary Operations
[2] Number System Conversion
[3] Exit

Menu-2 (Binary Operations)
[1] Division
[2] Multiplication
[3] Subtraction
[4] Addition
[5] Negative (2's Complement)

Menu-3 (Conversion)
[1] Binary to X
[2] Decimal to X
[3] Octal to X
[4] Hexa to X

Choosing 1 from Menu-1 will display Menu-2 while 2 from Menu-1 will display Menu-3. Choosing an option from Menu-2 will perform the binary operation according to what the user has selected from the options. In binary operations, it should consider signed binary for
fraction and whole number together with the appropriate sizes for binary (i.e., nibble, byte, and so on).

For Menu-3, when a user selects an option, this should carry out the conversion operation according to what the user has selected from the options. The conversion should consider signed numbers for fraction and whole number (You may use the programmerâ€™s calculator in
windows pc for your reference). Use the appropriate number complement for octal and hexadecimal to represent negative numbers.

Example:

Binary to X

Input Binary: 0001 0001
Output:

Decimal:          17
Hexa:               11
Octal:               21

You have to present this on or before the due date.
